<p>The coding challenge I had done for Mixmax (Soundcloud SDK integration) was fun, and I thought I could make yet another search feature for something I tend to share with people (especially through email). So I decided to make a search feature for Udacity courses! I have taken a few courses on the website and have found them very useful for learning a variety of things in the field of Computer Science. They have courses on data science, machine learning, web development, Android development and many more! Check your their <a data-rt-link-type="external" href="https://www.udacity.com/courses/all">catalog</a>! They also offer <a data-rt-link-type="external" href="https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree">Nanodegrees</a>!</p>

<h3>The way it works</h3>

<p>Assuming &nbsp;he&nbsp;<a data-rt-link-type="external" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mixmax-email-tracking-tem/ocpljaamllnldhepankaeljmeeeghnid">Mixmax chrome extension</a>&nbsp;is installed, one can add custom integration. The link to this integration and how to install it can be found on my&nbsp;<a data-rt-link-type="external" href="https://github.com/Jaytex/udacitymixmaxapi">Github for this project</a>.</p>

<p>The user then can start by typing /udacity&nbsp;into their email body as follows. Mixmax's neat autocomplete feature let's you select the feature you want to use once you have the least non-ambiguous prefix for the feature.</p>

<p>Once you've selected to use the Udacity search feature, you can simple type the title of your desired Udacity course. &nbsp;</p><p>In the example I want to search for a Material Design course for someone developing an Android application. Say the person I am sharing this with is a colleague at work who does not want a basic course but rather or more detailed/advanced course teaching to a more experienced audience. I don't know what courses the have so I simply search 'android' &nbsp;by typing <strong>/udacity android. I then scroll through the list and find a course that sounds like what I need and is aimed at the right level!</strong></p>

<h3>The Result</h3>

<p>Once the desired course has been selected &nbsp;it'll be embedded to the email body with the thumbnail and title.</p>

<p>After that the recipient simply clicks on the link in their email and it will take them to course's page on Udacity!</p>
